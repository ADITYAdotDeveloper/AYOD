# AYOD

An AI smart watch constantly listens to your body in the background — heart rate, skin response, respiration count, spO2, and movements — to understand how you feel.

It’s like the default state of the companion, always active, always learning your emotional rhythm.

## Personal Baseline

AYOD builds a personal baseline and senses when something changes:

* you’re stressed
* you’re overwhelmed
* you’re unusually calm
* you’re excited
* you’re anxious
* you’re emotionally heavy

This is the foundation of everything else.

## Instant Compassion

Whenever AYOD senses a meaningful emotional change, it responds with instant compassion — softly and gently. Like:

> “You seem overwhelmed — take a breath with me?”

And if you choose to talk, AYOD listens.

It remembers your story, reflects your feelings, and stays with you like a quiet emotional presence — always understanding, never judging.

## Agentic Mode

There is also an Agentic Mode — an AI-driven assistant (powered by LLMs) that you can activate whenever you need deeper thinking, creativity, planning, or productivity.

When asked, AYOD shifts into this mode to help you brainstorm, write, organize, or create.

## Privacy

Your emotional data is private. It is never shared with any third party.

## The Vision

Ultimately, AYOD is one single, seamless emotional companion — tracking how you feel, caring for you when you need support, listening like a friend, and becoming your creative assistant exactly when you need it.
